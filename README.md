# AI coding

Best tips:

- start with a high-level spec and implementation plan (new projects).
- plan the design with all tokens, components, patterns beforehand (new projects)
- for existing projects create the above create the above with the CLI apps
- provide a clear prompt of what to do, keep it small and feature-focused in Agile format (ticket/user story/sprint) for easier debugging, design mocks can be based off existing spec
- start in PLAN MODE (if available)
- start planning in the browser, CLI apps are best for executing
- prompt the AI to ask you follow-up questions 

## Claude Code vs Gemini CLI

Claude models are better at thinking and doing complex execution, higher completion rate but needs good guardrails, can usually one or two shot the solution.

Gemini models are better at creativity and vibing the solution, can work with good guardrails but requires more follow-up prompts, no plan mode can be gotten by prompting for one, better to use custom command or GEMINI.md file (but may not work all the time).
